## Licensing

This content is _not_ licensed for re-use, as these items generally represent brand-specific content. As such, we don't wish to support or encourage derivative work based on this content.

There also are some items included on the static server (e.g. fonts) are openly licensed, which we haven't modified.

The repository is public because the assets themselves are publicly available, so we see no need to make it private.
